      <p>Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true</li>
        <li>Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover if, else , else if statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if</li>
        <li>if else</li>
        <li>if else if else</li>
        <li>switch</li>
        <li>ternary operator</li>

      <h2>Day 4: Exercises</h2>
      <h3>Exercise: Level 1</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Get user input using prompt(“Enter your age:”). If user is 18 or older , give feedback:'You are old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to wait for the number of years he needs to turn 18.
          <pre>
            Enter your age: 30
            You are old enough to drive.

            Enter your age:15
            You are left with 3 years to drive.
          </pre>
          <pre style="color: #ccc">
            //  const age = prompt("Enter Here", "Enter your age:");
                const ageOldEnough = 18 - age;
                
                if (age >= 18) {
                  console.log("You are old enough to drive");
                } else {
                  console.log(`You are left with ${ageOldEnough} years to drive`);
                }
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(“Enter your age:”) to get the age as input.
          <pre>
            Enter your age: 30
            You are 5 years older than me.
          </pre>
          <pre style="color: #ccc">
            //  const myAge = prompt("Enter Here", "Enter your age:");
                const yourAge = 35;
                
                if (myAge < yourAge) {
                  console.log(`You are ${yourAge - myAge} years older than me.`);
                }
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways
          <pre>
            - using if else
            - ternary operator.

            let a = 4
            let b = 3

            4 is greater than 3
          </pre>
          <pre style="color: #ccc">
            //  let a = 4
                let b = 3

                // using if else
                if (a > b) {
                  console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`);
                } else {
                  console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
                }

                // using ternary operator
                a > b ? console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`) : console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?
          <pre>
            Enter a number: 2
            2 is an even number

            Enter a number: 9
            9 is is an odd number.
          </pre>
          <pre style="color: #ccc"> 
            //  const num = prompt("Enter Here", "Enter a number:");

                if (num % 2 == 0) {
                  console.log(`${num} is an even number.`);
                } else {
                  console.log(`${num} is an odd number.`);
                }
